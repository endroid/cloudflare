# Development Guidelines

* Use modern PascalCase for types, camelCase for other namings
* Do not use Props or Args classes, use direct arguments
* Do not pass errors inside objects, handle them early
* Each interface or model should be in its own file
* Do not create barrel files but import directly
* Use readable code and tests instead of documentation and comments
